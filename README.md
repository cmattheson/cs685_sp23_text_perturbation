#  Code Experiment Folder : cs685_sp23_text_perturbation
This folder contains various code files related to experiments using BERT models. The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of code snippets for running different experiments with BERT models. To execute the experiments, you only need to run a single file called run_ag_experiments.py.
# Instructions to run the code
1. Install the necessary packages listed in the requirements.txt file using the following command:

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can use the following commands to install the required dependencies:

    `pip install datasets`
    
    `pip install transformers`
    
    `pip install allennlp==2.10.1`
3.  Open the run_ag_experiments.py file.
4.  Inside the file, you will find multiple function calls, each corresponding to a specific model. Choose the model you want to run by uncommenting the respective function call and commenting out other <br>
    a.  Concatenated <br>
    b.  Additive  <br>
5. Save the changes to the run_ag_experiments.py file.
6. Execute the run_ag_experiments.py file. You can do this by running the following command:

    `python run_ag_experiments.py`
7. The selected BERT model experiment will start running, and you will see the output in the console or terminal window.
